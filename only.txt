Only Text
=========
This blog is only text files. It has no HTML, no CSS, nor any JavaScript. It's a
folder of unassuming text files on a server somewhere on the internet. It
doesn't even have clickable links, you navigate by changing the URL manually and
hoping for the best. This seems backwards and unnecessary and in this post, I'll
explain why you're most probably right. I'll also explain why I'm doing this,
the advantages, plans and a spec if you want to do the same to your blog.


Why
---
The current web is useful but complex. The current level of interactivity
warrants such complexity. But we have to ask if we warrant such
interactivity. A blog at its core is just a collection of documents. I looked
around for the simplest way to write documents and share them on the internet, and I
settled on plain HTML pages with no CSS. While writing my HTML documents, I
realised nothing is stopping me from adding CSS, JS and anything else in
the future. I wanted to deny myself that
[affordance](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances).
That's when I decided to write my blog as a collection of text files.
That was the reason for starting this, these are the reasons for keeping it that way.

* Anti Excess
The modern web is excess in every possible direction. That is the price for
evolving collaboratively and being incredibly useful. It's not uncommon for
Single Page Apps ship with megabytes of bundled Javascript. That bundle size
might be justifiable for Figma, but for my blog, I felt it would be an excess. I
wanted the simplest way to deliver my writing to people who want to read it and
a text file was the second choice right behind writing on paper and putting it
up on a wall.

* Plain
It's just plain text. The entire formatting is contained in the file itself. You
do not need a parser or a rendering engine to read this file how it was meant to
be read. It can be read by every text editor, text based browsers, and 40 year
old hardware, so I'm betting this can be read 400 years from now too.

* WYSIWYG
When I was writing my old blog, I'd have to open a console and run the engine
locally to see how my post would turn out. Even though hot reload made the
changes instantaneous, I'd still have to tab away and look. Now the file I'm
editing is the output itself. I can see and format the file itself, and how I
see it will be exactly how other will see it too. This makes me concentrate more
on the writing itself. There is also no build step, you edit the text files and
push it when you're done.

* Parsable
Even though the content is written in plain text, it's written in adhereance to
a defined spec for future changes. With a minimal surface to parse, I can hand
roll a parser and easily convert to a PDF if I want to.

* End of Civilization
I'm a definite optimist and believe that we can improve the world if we try our
best. I'm also aware of the fact that a small number of probable events may lead
to the collapse of civilization as we know it. If something like that happens
all the institutional knowledge about computing systems will be lost. When we
rebuild, one of the first things will be a way to read and write text. I want my
writings to be there still.


Spec
----
I have decided to keep the spec minimal and do the rest as a format. The spec
should be followed for future parsers, and the format is for human readers.

* Links
The site is a collection of text files in a flat directory.
  - [link text](https://full-url.com)
  - [link text](./relative-url-to-current-file)
  - [url]()

* Heading
  - Primary Heading (H1)
    ```
    Heading
    =======
    ```
  - Secondary Heading
    ```
    Heading
    -------
    ```
  - Headings
    ```
    * H3
    ** H4
    *** H5
    **** H6
    ```

* CodeBlocks
  - Codeblocks have `inline-code`
    ```
    multiline
    codeblock
    ```

* Lists
  - list item 1
  - list item 2


Format
------
This is to make the file more scannable for human readers.

- Lines should be hard broken at 80char width
- Double line breaks between Primary and Secondary Heading
- Single line breaks between other headings


Future
------
I really have fun wiriting this blog in plain text. I just open up my editor
write and format the text how I want it to and just publish it. There is no
fiddling endlessly to make something look marginally better, no hard feelings
about comparing my writing to others. Personally this is a win, and I have even
better plans for the future.

Since this is just text, we can easily parse and show this on the console, and
since this is just text, we can easily transmit this. I'm thinking about
building a distributed protocol for text based blogs, kind of on the side of the
internet, away from all the noise of the real world. A small corner of the
digital space for people who love plain text and plain writing and plain simple
things. This is just an idea going on in my heads, but let's see how that goes.
