Phoenix LiveView in Production
==============================
I came across a
[thread](https://elixirforum.com/t/are-you-all-in-on-liveview-how-are-you-using-it/41628/14)
on ElixirForum that highglighted how everyone was using LiveView in their
production apps. It also highlighted some awesome blog posts about using
LiveView in production. Since IndiePaper is a Phoenix LiveView app, I thought it
would be nice to share my expereince with it.


Context
-------
Before we jump right in, it would be wise to share about who I am and specifics
about the project. I'm a single developer working on IndiePaper. It is a book
publishing platform, where authors can write out their book in our online text
editor and we typeset beautiful PDF books from them. The app is a simple CRUD
app with auth, uploads and a custom typesetting engine.
