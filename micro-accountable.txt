Micro Accountability
====================
Previously there was no easy way to share you thouts with a large enough
audience. You had to be an expert to get your opinion to a set of people. That's
why in the olden time of teh television we had more levels of accountability
that what we have now. People who were experts who worked their whole life on
things were the only ones who were qualitifed to share their opinions. Hence it
was possible to atleast believe what was right. Now everyone has an opinion and
an easy way to share it with everyone. This means accountbility went throught
the drain. People quote simple opinions one time and share at as themselves.
When they are proven wrong, they fallback on teh adage that it was created by
someone else. This causes fake information to spread.
